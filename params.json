{"body":"##Use DTOx to quickly create well formed DTOs\r\nThe [Data Transfer Object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) is a lightweight, serializeable object for the purpose of transferring data. They can be valuable in the development of APIs where you would like to expose simple objects, and clean documentation. Writing them and their tests can be tedious at times, so use this package to quickly create them for your project. \r\n\r\n###Example\r\nTo create a DTO for our fictitious SludgeCo App, a command like this will do the trick:\r\n\r\n    $ dtox react dto 'SludgeCo\\Acid\\BurnyDTO' string:name int:burnLevel\r\n    \r\nThis will create a `BurnyDTO.php` dto in the `SludgeCo/Acid/` directory relative to where you run the command. Inside the file you will find a documented and PSR-2 compliant DTO class that implements the `\\Serializable` interface.\r\n\r\nTo create the corresponding Unit Test for the DTO, use a command like this:\r\n\r\n    $ dtox react dto-unit 'SludgeCo\\Acid\\BurnyDTO' \"Red Acid:name\" 10:burnLevel\r\n\r\nThis will create a `BurnyDTOTest.php test class in the `SludgeCo/Acid/` directory relative to where you run the command. Note that instead of the variable type you put the test data that you want to include in the test class. \r\n\r\n##Installing\r\nAdd the package to your `composer.json` file:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"require\": {\r\n            \"jrobertfox/dtox\": \"dev-master\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen install:\r\n\r\n    $ composer install\r\n    \r\n##Usage\r\nThe utility, right now, supports the `react` command to create a reaction with your \"formula.\" The format is such:\r\n\r\n    $dtox react <FORMULA> <FULLY_QUALIFIED_CLASS_NAME> <VARIABLE_1> ... <VARIABLE_N>\r\n    \r\n**Formula** - the type of object you want to \"react\" (\"dto\" and \"dto-unit\" are currently supported)\r\n\r\n**Fully Qualified Class Name** - The full name of your class, including the namespace.\r\n\r\n**Variables** - Variables in the form `<TYPE>:<NAME>` that will be included in the DTO construction, for example `string:name` will create add a `$name` variable with the type `string`. For Test classes the form is `<TEST_DATA>:<NAME>`. This lets you build out your tests with realistic data.\r\n\r\n### Support and Roadmap\r\nHave an idea for a feature or found a bug?
